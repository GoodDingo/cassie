Herein are a list of known issues and areas for improvementâ€“

# Mixed Java/Scala data structures

We currently use a mix of java and scala data structures. We should really standardize on one,
then provide wrappers for others. THe plan is to standardize on scala data structures internally and
then provide wrappers for java compatibility/ease-of-use.

# Code duplication

We've duplicated code across ColumFamily, SuperColumFamily, CounterColumFamily and SuperCounterColumFamily.
We need to pull this back together in a more sane way. (also Column and CounterColumn)

# Incomplete Cassandra feature support

Not all cassandra operations are supported (we've taken a JIT approach).

# Iteratee code is fragile and complicated

We should move to Finagle Spools.
